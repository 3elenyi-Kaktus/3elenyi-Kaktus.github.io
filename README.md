# Persistent Queue Visualisator
This is the visualisation of one of the possible algorithms
for persistent queue datastructure storaging and simple
operations provisioning.<br>
Algorithm is based on building auxiliary tree, besides the
persistent queue tree itself.<br>
It provides constant complexity of queue `Pop` and `Push` operations
and linear memory usage complexity.<br>
Brief instructions to the algorithm usage and interface are present
on the website itself.
